## Learning Points

This application challenged me greatly. As it was the first hands on experience I've really had with MySQL I had to overcome many obstacles. These obstacles included removing excess code from the schema.sql and seeds.sql modules, learning how to correctly link the server.js module, and lastly how to use 'dotenv' to secure passwords and other information.
